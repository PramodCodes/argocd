# Git Ops - Apr 18 2025 03:15:15pm

## What is gitops 
Git becomes a single source of truth in Gitops to deliver apps and infra. GitOps uses git to track the changes for infra and apps.

## Basic thing in git ops
You can take an application and use a git ops controller (ArgoCD / FluxCD ) and deploy into your and deploy into your k8s controller 

## What will happen Without gitops
You are trying to deploy your application on kubernetes.
We want to update a change to kubernetes worker node (by adding taint / want to increase resource of worker node).
### Scenario Tracking infra changes
a person updated the node configuration, and after few days you want to know what change you made exactly or someone asks you about the change you made.
how will you track your change and remember the exact details of the change?
> No mechanism to track the changes to kubernetes cluster.
> You cannot know what changes are made to kubernetes cluster before certain period of time.
> i.e there is no versioning, and no auditing, You don't actually who is making change.You can check the logins in machine, but you cannot map the changes with the user(Which change is made by which user is hard to trace).
## Before gitops
#### Tracking application changes 
##### CI - application changes 
> You can track all the changes made to application through github, When we want to make change, we create a PR & PR goes through PR verification.
##### CD - infrastructure changes
You are making change by using shell scripts / python scripts and make changes using kubectl /helm or anything and deploy it to kubernetes.But there is no tracking without git. 
**Question: How legacy systems are tracking changes then?**
They take backup of existing file by copying them and rotating the files.

All the sourcecode is version controlled and tracked properly.
